What..
is this?

A spaceship.

Yes I know it's a spaceship you idiot.
I was more wondering
who does it belong to.
Where did it come from? 
What secrets does it hold?

*door rattles and starts closing behind you*

Wait, Ma-!!

Ahhh! *falls to the ground*

Are you ok??! *muffled* 

I'm fine! I'll head to the control room and try to
turn the power back onto the door!

Okay! We'll try everything we can out here to get you out!
